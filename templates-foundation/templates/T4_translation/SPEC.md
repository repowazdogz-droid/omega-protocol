# T4 — Cross-Domain Translation Template — SPEC

## Purpose
A static spatial template that shows how the same underlying structure means different things to different domains — without simplifying away truth.

This template demonstrates that multiple valid interpretations can coexist for the same system, enabling understanding of disagreement without argument.

## What This IS
- A cross-domain meaning translation surface
- A way to see the same system through multiple lenses
- A bridge between disciplines without losing nuance

## What This IS NOT
- An optimizer
- A resolver of trade-offs
- A recommendation system
- A decision-maker
- A way to "prove" one view is correct

## Core Rule
**Geometry is invariant; interpretation changes.**

The same spatial structure (e.g., an articulated arm + workspace) is viewed through three lenses:
- Engineering
- Clinical / Human
- Research / Theory

Same geometry. Different labels + emphasis. No geometry moves.

## Core Grammar (Toggleable Layers)
1) ENGINEERING VIEW (Engineering)
- Reach envelope
- Constraints
- Failure margins
- Uncertainty halos

2) CLINICAL VIEW (Clinical)
- Human proximity zones
- Safety buffers
- Fatigue / trust regions
- Ambiguity zones

3) RESEARCH VIEW (Research)
- Assumptions
- Model limits
- Unsupported inference zones
- Open questions

## Interaction (Inherited Contract)
Allowed:
- orbit/pan/zoom
- toggles for Engineering / Clinical / Research views
- click elements to inspect domain-specific meaning
- reset view

Disallowed:
- resolving which view is "correct"
- recommendations ("use this view")
- optimization or advice
- simulation or prediction

## Inspector Fields (Required)
For each selectable element:
- Name (domain-specific)
- Domain: Engineering | Clinical | Research
- Meaning in this domain (1–2 lines)
- What it explicitly does NOT claim (1 line)
- NOT THIS (not a verdict, not advice)

## Calm Completion Criterion
Done when someone can say:
- "Engineers see limits."
- "Clinicians see risk."
- "Researchers see assumptions."
- "All are looking at the same system."
Without asking "which one is right?"

## Why All Layers Can Be Simultaneously True
Each domain brings valid concerns:
- Engineering: physical constraints and failure modes
- Clinical: human safety and trust boundaries
- Research: epistemic limits and assumptions

These are not contradictions; they are complementary perspectives on the same reality.

## Warning
This template does not resolve trade-offs. It makes them visible and understandable across domains.
