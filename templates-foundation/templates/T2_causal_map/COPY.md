Omega Template — Causal Map (Non-Temporal)

## On-Screen Subtitle
Conceptual influence map — no time, no simulation, no prediction.

## Footer (Trust Contract, Visible)
Human-led. Non-autonomous. Visual reasoning only.
This map shows influences within bounds — not forecasts or recommendations.

## Inspector Default Text
Click a node or link to inspect.

## Inspector: NODE Template
Element: {Name}
Type: {Type}
Role: {Role}
Status: {Known | Assumed | Unknown | Contested}
Definition: {1–2 lines}

NOT THIS:
This is not a prediction, diagnosis, or recommendation.

## Inspector: LINK Template
Link: {From} → {To}
Influence sign: {+ | - | mixed | unknown}
Strength band: {low | medium | high} (illustrative)
Evidence: {observed | theoretical | assumed | unknown}
Confounders: {list | not assessed}
Constraint: {none | reason}

NOT THIS:
This link is not a forecast. It does not imply "what will happen."

## Mandatory Copy Rules (Hard)
- Use "influence", "depends on", "is associated with" (when uncertain)
- Avoid "will cause", "leads to", "therefore" unless Evidence=observed AND confounders assessed
- Never output "best", "optimal", "should"
- If uncertain: say so plainly; do not soften

## Language for Disallowed Links
Use one sentence, neutral:
"This causal inference is not supported here: {reason}."

## Calm Style Notes
- Short sentences
- No hype
- No persuasion
- No motivational tone
- No conclusions
