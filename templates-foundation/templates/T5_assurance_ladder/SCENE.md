# T5 — Assurance Ladder (Scene)

## Purpose
A static spatial template that communicates **assurance-bounded outcomes** under degradation, without procedures, thresholds, or certification claims.

## Spatial elements
- **Inputs (tiles):** what degraded + confidence (conceptual)
- **Authority (A1–A4):** remaining control authority bands
- **Outcomes (S1–S4):** outcome classes defined by "what can be guaranteed"
- **Overrides:** hard disallow constraints (environment/ethics/time)
- **Trace:** illustrative auditability links (inputs → authority → outcomes, constrained by overrides)

## Interaction contract
Camera orbit/pan/zoom, layer toggles, click-to-inspect, reset view.
Nothing moves except the camera.

## Non-operational guarantee
This scene is conceptual: it does not compute classifications, does not recommend actions, and does not claim compliance/certification.
