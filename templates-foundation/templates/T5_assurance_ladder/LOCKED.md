# T5 LOCKED
T5 is complete and frozen.

Allowed changes:
- bug fixes
- minor visual polish that does not add interactions
- copy tweaks that strengthen: "conceptual, non-operational, not certification"

Disallowed changes:
- operational thresholds, procedures, step-by-step instructions
- claims of compliance/certification
- recommendations ("do S2")
- automation hooks, run buttons, or decision engines
- numeric risk scoring

If it starts to look like control logic, revert it.
