# T5 — Assurance Ladder (Copy)

## Title
Assurance Ladder

## Subtitle
Outcome guarantees under degradation — conceptual, non-operational.

## Footer / trust contract
Human-led. Non-autonomous. Visual reasoning only.
This shows bounded outcome classes — not procedures, not commands, not certification.

## Inspector tone rules
- Describe meaning, not advice
- Use "NOT THIS" lines to prevent misreadings
- Avoid "should", "best", "optimal", "choose"

## One-line explainer (demo)
"This is a guarantee ladder: what remains possible, what is disallowed, and why — without pretending it's a control system."
