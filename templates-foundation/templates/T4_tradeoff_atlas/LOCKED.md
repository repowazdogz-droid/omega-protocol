# T4 LOCKED
T4 is complete and frozen.

Allowed changes:
- bug fixes
- minor visual polish that does not add interactions
- copy tweaks that strengthen the trust contract (no "should" language)

Disallowed changes:
- optimization language (best/optimal/choose/recommend)
- sliders, solvers, computed fronts
- numerical scoring or ranking
- prediction or planning features
- any interaction that changes the model (dragging/editing)

If it feels like a decision engine, revert it.
