# T4 — Tradeoff Atlas — COPY

## Title
Omega Template — Tradeoff Atlas

## Subtitle
Conceptual tradeoff map — no optimization, no advice, no prediction.

## Footer (Trust Contract)
Human-led. Non-autonomous. Visual reasoning only.
This shows tensions and constraints — it does not select an answer.

## Inspector Default
Click an element to inspect what it represents.

## Inspector: OBJECTIVE
Element: {Objective name}
Meaning: {1 line}
Common tradeoff: {1 line}

NOT THIS:
Not a ranking. Not a target. Not a command.

## Inspector: CONSTRAINT
Element: {Constraint name}
Type: {physics | budget | time | ethics}
What it forbids: {1 line}
Why it exists: {1 line}

NOT THIS:
Not advice. Not a policy. Not "the right way".

## Inspector: FEASIBLE REGION
Element: Feasible Region
Meaning: "Options that remain inside constraints."
Assumptions: {1 line}

NOT THIS:
Not complete. Not guaranteed. Not validated.

## Inspector: TRADEOFF FRONT
Element: Tradeoff Front
Meaning: "A visible tension zone between objectives."
Why it matters: {1 line}

NOT THIS:
Not computed. Not an optimum. Not a recommendation.

## Inspector: UNCERTAINTY
Element: Uncertainty Region
Meaning: "Feasibility is unclear or assumption-driven here."
What would reduce uncertainty: {1 line}

NOT THIS:
Not a hazard. Not a forecast. Not a verdict.

## Mandatory Copy Rules (Hard)
- Use: constraints / tradeoff / feasible / unclear / assumption
- Avoid: best / optimal / should / recommend / choose
- Never convert tradeoffs into decisions unless the user explicitly asks
