Conceptual assumption map — no truth claims, no control, no prediction.

## Footer (Trust Contract, Visible)
Human-led. Non-autonomous. Visual reasoning only.
This space shows assumptions and incompatibilities — not conclusions or advice.

## Inspector: ASSUMPTION Template
Element: {A# — Name}
Type: {definition | method | data | ethics | scope}
Status: {Known | Assumed | Unknown | Contested}
Confidence band: {low | medium | high} (illustrative)
Statement: {1–2 lines}
If false, what breaks: {1 line}

NOT THIS:
This is not a verified fact or a verdict.

## Inspector: CONFLICT Template
Element: {C# — Conflict name}
Assumptions involved: {A#, A#}
Reason: {definition mismatch | scope mismatch | measurement mismatch | dependency missing | logical contradiction}
Why it matters: {1 line}

NOT THIS:
This is not "error" — it is an incompatibility within the current framing.

## Inspector: UNSUPPORTED REGION Template
Element: {U# — Unsupported region}
Meaning: This area is not covered by stated assumptions.
Implication: Additional assumptions or evidence may be required.

NOT THIS:
Not an obstacle. Not a hazard. Not a prediction.

## Mandatory Copy Rules (Hard)
- Use: assumption / framing / incompatibility / not covered
- Avoid: wrong / correct / prove / truth / best
- Never prescribe fixes unless explicitly asked
