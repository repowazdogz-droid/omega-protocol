# T3 LOCKED
T3 is complete and frozen.

Allowed changes:
- bug fixes
- minor visual polish that does not add interactions
- copy tweaks to strengthen neutrality and the trust contract

Disallowed changes:
- advice, recommendations, "fix" prompts
- scoring or ranking assumptions
- editing assumptions in UI
- animation, timelines, "run" buttons
- anything that implies truth claims or verdicts

If it feels like judgment, revert it.
