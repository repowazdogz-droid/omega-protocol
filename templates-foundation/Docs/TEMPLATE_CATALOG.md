# TEMPLATE CATALOG (FOUNDATION SET)

This repository contains a small set of reusable templates.
Each template is a "thinking surface" with a strict trust contract.

## T1 — Spatial Constraint & Uncertainty (BUILT)
Purpose:
- Show structure, constraints, and unknown regions in a static spatial scene.

Status:
- Implemented as V1 robot arm workspace demo (to be migrated into /templates/T1 later).

## T2 — Causal Map (NON-TEMPORAL)
Purpose:
- Show influence relationships between concepts/components without timeline or prediction.
Core layers:
- Nodes (Structure)
- Influence links (Constraints)
- Uncertainty halos (Uncertainty)

## T3 — Assumption Surface
Purpose:
- Make assumptions visible as surfaces/volumes.
- Show conflicts where assumptions overlap or contradict.
Core layers:
- Assumption volumes (Structure)
- Conflicts/intersections (Constraints)
- Confidence opacity (Uncertainty)

## T4 — Translation Bridge (CROSS-DOMAIN)
Purpose:
- Show the same system through multiple "lenses" (engineering/clinical/math/human).
Core layers:
- Shared geometry (Structure)
- Lens overlays (Constraints/Uncertainty)
- Terminology mappings (Inspector)

## T5 — Capability Boundary (ANTI-HYPE)
Purpose:
- Show what a system can/cannot do and where it degrades.
Core layers:
- Capability envelope (Envelope)
- Failure/degrade regions (Constraints)
- Unknown/untested regions (Uncertainty)

## T6 — Learning & Reflection (ND-FRIENDLY)
Purpose:
- Capture "before/after" understanding without judgment.
Core layers:
- Snapshot A vs Snapshot B (Structure)
- Surprises/mismatches (Constraints)
- Remaining unknowns (Uncertainty)
