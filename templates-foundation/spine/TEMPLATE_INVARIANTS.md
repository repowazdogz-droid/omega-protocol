# TEMPLATE INVARIANTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

These invariants apply to every template in this repository.

## 1) Static by Default
- No time progression
- No physics
- No "run" button
- No prediction
- No execution
- No optimisation

If motion exists, it must be explicitly human-driven (e.g., camera only).

## 2) Human-Led, Non-Autonomous
- The system never initiates actions
- The system never decides priorities
- The system never recommends "best" choices
- The system never substitutes human judgment

## 3) Trust Contract Must Be Visible
Every template must clearly state on-screen:
- what it IS
- what it IS NOT

This is part of the product, not documentation.

## 4) Same Core Grammar
Every template uses a consistent grammar:
- STRUCTURE: what exists
- ENVELOPE: what is theoretically possible (optional)
- CONSTRAINTS: what limits or forbids
- UNCERTAINTY: what is unknown/assumed/weak

Templates may rename these, but cannot remove the functions.

## 5) Legibility Over Realism
Prefer:
- simple geometry
- clear layers
- honest uncertainty
Over:
- realism
- animation
- cinematic effects

## 6) Calm Completion Criterion
A template is "done" when it feels:
- calm
- legible
- explainable in 60 seconds
- non-simulative

If it starts to feel like a simulator, it has failed.

## 7) Safety Posture
- No operational control
- No instructions for real-world actuation
- No content that increases harm capability

If in doubt: reduce capability, increase clarity.
