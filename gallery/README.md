# Omega Spatial Gallery

## What this is
A static gallery of Omega spatial reasoning templates:
- human-led
- non-autonomous
- visual reasoning only
- no simulation, no prediction, no recommendations

If it feels like a simulator or decision engine, it has failed.

## Run locally
From repo root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open:
- http://localhost:8000/gallery/

## Demos included
- V1 — Trust Surface (Robot Workspace)
- T2 — Causal Map
- T3 — Assumption Surface
- T4 — Tradeoff Atlas
- T5 — Assurance Ladder

## Demo script (30 seconds)

"This is a calm spatial interface for structure, assumptions, tradeoffs, and assurance.
Nothing runs. Nothing decides. Uncertainty is explicit."
