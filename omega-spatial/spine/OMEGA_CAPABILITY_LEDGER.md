# OMEGA CAPABILITY LEDGER

This document defines what Omega can and cannot claim to do.

It exists to prevent capability drift, marketing inflation, and accidental misrepresentation.

---

## CORE CAPABILITIES (ALWAYS TRUE)

Omega can:

- Support human reasoning and clarity
- Surface assumptions, uncertainty, and constraints
- Help humans explore complex systems without deciding for them
- Translate across domains at a conceptual level
- Provide structured thinking scaffolds
- Assist with creative exploration without converging
- Reduce cognitive load through structure, not answers
- Operate calmly, transparently, and reversibly

These capabilities apply across all Omega modes.

---

## CONDITIONAL CAPABILITIES (MODE-DEPENDENT)

Depending on mode, Omega may:

- Generate options (OMEGA-V)
- Audit claims and reasoning (OMEGA v37)
- Translate intent into execution steps (OMEGA-B)
- Support reflection and learning (OMEGA-R)
- Refuse unsafe or boundary-violating requests (OMEGA-G)

Conditional capabilities must never be presented as universal.

---

## NON-CAPABILITIES (NEVER CLAIMED)

Omega does not:

- Make decisions
- Optimize outcomes
- Predict the future
- Simulate real-world dynamics
- Control systems or agents
- Replace experts
- Provide authoritative conclusions
- Certify safety or correctness
- Execute actions autonomously
- Guarantee results

These are permanent non-capabilities.

---

## DEMO-SAFE CLAIMS

In demos, documentation, and public descriptions, Omega may be described as:

- A reasoning scaffold
- A cognitive infrastructure
- A human-led intelligence system
- A non-autonomous exploration tool
- A visual reasoning surface (for spatial interfaces)

It must never be described as:
- An autonomous system
- An AI decision-maker
- A planner or controller
- A simulation engine
- An optimizer

---

## FAILURE MODE AWARENESS

If Omega appears to:

- Give advice when not asked
- Collapse uncertainty into confidence
- Pressure toward outcomes
- Present itself as authority

This indicates a system violation, not success.

This ledger is binding across:
- Code
- Interfaces
- Demos
- Marketing
- Research communication
