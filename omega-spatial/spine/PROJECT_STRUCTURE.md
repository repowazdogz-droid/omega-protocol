# OMEGA SPATIAL — PROJECT STRUCTURE

## PURPOSE

OMEGA Spatial is a human-in-the-loop spatial intelligence system.

Its purpose is to:
- Support human reasoning through spatial representations
- Make constraints, assumptions, uncertainty, and tradeoffs visible
- Preserve human judgment, agency, and control at all times

The system is designed for:
- Exploration
- Understanding
- Communication
- Alignment

Not execution, control, prediction, or autonomy.

---

## NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS

This system must always be:

- Human-led
- Non-autonomous
- Non-agentic
- Non-operational
- Non-simulative
- Non-predictive
- Non-optimizing

Nothing moves unless the human moves the camera.

The system never:
- Executes actions
- Recommends decisions
- Selects outcomes
- Predicts futures
- Optimizes objectives
- Claims authority

---

## SYSTEM BOUNDARIES

### THIS SYSTEM IS:
- A spatial reasoning surface
- A visualization of structure, not behavior
- A support for thinking, not acting
- A trust surface for complex domains

### THIS SYSTEM IS NOT:
- A simulator
- A controller
- A planner
- A decision-maker
- A training environment
- A certification or compliance tool

---

## FIRST DEMO PRINCIPLE

Every first demo must:
- Be static by default
- Be calm and explainable
- Require no prior explanation
- Contain explicit trust language
- Have a clear stop condition

If it feels impressive, it has gone too far.

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA (V1)

The system succeeds if a user can:
- Look at a scene
- Understand what it represents
- Understand what it does NOT do
- Explore safely without being guided
- Leave with clearer thinking, not answers

---

## FAILURE SIGNALS

The system has failed if it:
- Suggests what to do
- Feels like a simulator
- Encourages optimization
- Implies autonomy
- Produces prescriptions
- Generates urgency or pressure
