# OMEGA SPINE INDEX

This index defines the canonical reading order for the Omega system.

The spine must be read top-to-bottom.

---

## 1. PROJECT STRUCTURE

**File:** `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`

Defines:
- System goal
- Non-negotiable constraints
- What Omega is / is not
- Core capabilities
- Success criteria

This file answers: "What is this system?"

---

## 2. OMEGA OVERVIEW

**File:** `OMEGA_README.md`

Defines:
- The five Omega modes
- Why they exist
- How they differ
- Why separation matters

This file answers: "What are the parts?"

---

## 3. MODE SELECTION LOGIC

**File:** `OMEGA_MODE_GUIDE.md`

Defines:
- When each mode is used
- Mode precedence rules
- Mode transition rules

This file answers: "Which Omega applies right now?"

---

## 4. CAPABILITY LEDGER

**File:** `OMEGA_CAPABILITY_LEDGER.md`

Defines:
- What Omega can do
- What Omega cannot do
- Demo-safe claims
- Failure signals

This file answers: "What may we claim?"

---

## 5. CORE CONTRACT

**File:** `CONTRACT.md`

Defines:
- Immutable principles
- Human sovereignty
- Non-autonomy
- Demo safety
- Failure interpretation

This file answers: "What must never change?"

---

## 6. FREEZE LINE

**File:** `OMEGA_FREEZE_LINE.md`

Defines:
- Which files are frozen
- What requires explicit review
- How evolution may occur

This file answers: "What is locked?"

---

## READING RULE

If any document conflicts with another:

1. CONTRACT.md overrides all
2. OMEGA_FREEZE_LINE.md overrides implementation
3. CAPABILITY_LEDGER overrides demos and claims
4. MODE_GUIDE overrides interaction behavior
5. PROJECT_STRUCTURE defines scope

---

## SYSTEM STATUS

At this point:

- Omega core is sealed
- Modes are defined
- Capabilities are bounded
- Autonomy is constrained
- Demos can be built safely
- Expansion is allowed only outside the spine

The spine is complete.
